% Function:         S_MSE= objfun(FVr_temp, S_struct)
% Author:           Rainer Storn
% Description:      Implements the cost function to be minimized.
%                   Rastrigin's function is based on a quadratic function
%                   with the addition of cosine modulation to produce
%                   many local minima. Thus the test function is highly
%                   multimodal. However, the locations of the minima are
%                   regularly distributed.
% Parameters:       FVr_temp     (I)    Paramter vector
%                   S_Struct     (I)    Contains a variety of parameters.
%                                       For details see Rundeopt.m
% Return value:     S_MSE.I_nc   (O)    Number of constraints
%                   S_MSE.FVr_ca (O)    Constraint values. 0 means the constraints
%                                       are met. Values > 0 measure the distance
%                                       to a particular constraint.
%                   S_MSE.I_no   (O)    Number of objectives.
%                   S_MSE.FVr_oa (O)    Objective function values.
